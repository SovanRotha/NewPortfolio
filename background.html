                <li>2019-2021</li>
                    <p>I attended Kampong Thom Secondary School, where I built a strong academic foundation and developed my interest in technology and problem-solving. These years helped me improve my study habits, teamwork, and critical thinking skills, which later prepared me for success in high school.</p>
                <li>2022-2024</li>
                    <p>I continued my education at Kampong Thom High School, where I worked hard and successfully graduated with Grade A. During this time, I actively participated in various school activities and projects that strengthened my leadership, creativity, and communication skills. My high school journey was both challenging and rewarding, marking one of my proudest achievements in my academic life.</p><br>
                <li>2024-present</li>
                    <p>I am currently studying at the American University of Phnom Penh (AUPP), majoring in Software Development. Through my studies, I am learning about programming, web development, and problem-solving in the digital world. I am passionate about exploring how technology can create solutions that make people’s lives easier. My goal is to become a skilled software developer who can contribute to the growth of Cambodia’s technology industry.</p><br>
